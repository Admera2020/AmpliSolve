How to run AmpliSolve ?? 
====================================================================================================

Here we provide execution examples for all execution modes provided by AmpliSolve. 

To make the examples more interactive we also provide toy data (not actual patient's data) that you can find in different folders. 

The folder names are self explanatory. 

If, for any reason, you face problems running AmpliSolve please contact the developer dimitrios DOT kleftogiannis AT icr DOT ac DOT uk 



AmplisolvePreProCN
====================================================================================================
AmplisolvePreProCN is a pre-processing program for estimating CN aberrations. It uses a population of normal 
samples in the bam format, to estimate the baseline coverate distribution for copy neutral regions. To run this 
program you execute ./AmpliSolvePreProCN

Before running this program make sure that samtools and bedtools are installed and present in your PATH.

Once you are sure that samtools and bedtools are working fine, you will need a couple of arguments that are described below:

1. panel_design --> This is a bed format that contains the amplicons. We provide a sample panel-design at folder myBED.
The file example_panel_design.bed contains the chromosome and the start and end positions of the amplicons plus some 
additional informations.

2. germline_dir --> Since AmpliSolve is a population based method it relies on a number of normal samples (usually germline 
from saliva). Give the full path of the directory that contains all the bam files you have. The files have to be sorted and 
indexed with samtools. The current version of the program is case sensitive so please name the files with the extenstion .bam 
and not .BAM
In folder Germline_samples we provide examples for running the program.

3. Q --> You need to specify a minimum mapping quality similar to the samtools Q argument. 

4. chromosome  --> The program estimates the CN aberrations per chromosome. Please give the chromosome names correctly, because 
they have to match the chromosome names in the panel_design and in the bam file of the normals.

5. output --> The program generates a folder named with name "output" to store the main results and some other intermediate file 
that are produced. Give the full path of the directory you want to generate.

Now, we give an execution example based on the provided data.

Assuming that we have compiled all binaries in the source_coded folder. From this folder we can directly run the following command:

./AmpliSolvePreProCN panel_design=/Users/Dimitrios/Programs/AmpliSolve_Execution_Example/myBED/example_panel_design.bed germline_dir=/Users/Dimitrios/Programs/AmpliSolve_Execution_ExampleAmpliSolve_Execution_Example/Germline_samples Q=20 chromosome=chrX output=/Users/Dimitrios/Programs/AmpliSolve_Execution_Example/AmpliSolveTesting

Give the arguments with this order (and only) and always put "=" after the argument name. 

If you dont specify the correct number of arguments the program will terminate. Under this execution the program will generate folder /Users/Dimitrios/Programs/AmpliSolve_Execution_Example/AmpliSolveTesting
to store the results. 

The results for this execution should be chrX_germline_ratios.txt and a sub-folder named chrX_PreProCN_interm_files.
